# Hi, I'm Ege! 👋

I'm a driven software developer with experience in `.NET`, `HTML/CSS`, `JavaScript`, and `Python`. I love problem solving, creating intuitive and engaging web experiences and am deeply interested in blending technology with thoughtful design.

## 🔭 What I'm currently working on

### 📚 [BookTracker](https://github.com/ErdagEge/book-tracker-app)
A full-stack web app that lets you search, rate, review, and track books you've read — using the Google Books API, React, Express, and MongoDB. It supports adding start/finish dates, inline editing, and live CRUD operations. Fast, clean, and ready for more.

### 🎬 CineMCP
An AI-assisted movie recommendation web app that personalizes suggestions using user preferences, mood, and real-time movie data from TMDB. Built with vanilla JavaScript (frontend) and modular Node.js/Express (backend), powered by a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) with OpenAI integration.

### 🎙️ [Podcast Archive Platform](https://erdagege.github.io/podcast-archive/)
A creative podcast archive platform to organize and share cultural and philosophical content from my podcast **Açık Büfe Diyalog**. Built for clarity, long-term access, and themed browsing.

### ✍️ Creative Writing & Worldbuilding
Exploring speculative fiction and interactive storytelling through a worldbuilding project that merges visual art, narrative, and mechanics inspired by fantasy themes.
