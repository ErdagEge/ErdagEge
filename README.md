# Hi, I'm Ege! 👋

I'm a driven software developer experienced in creating scalable web applications and interactive user interfaces with `.NET`, `JavaScript` (mainly with `React`/`Next.js` and `Node.js`/`Express`), alongside embedded programming experience with `Python` on `Raspberry Pi`. I enjoy problem solving, creating intuitive and engaging web experiences and am deeply interested in blending technology with thoughtful, impactful design.

## 🔭 What I'm currently working on

### 🍿 [Movie Night Negotiator](https://github.com/ErdagEge/movie-night-negotiator)
Pick a movie together. Create a lobby, everyone adds titles and ranks them, and the app computes a fair winner (Borda). It’s multiplayer, live, and free-tier friendly. Optional AI provides a short “why this fits everyone” rationale when you finalize.

### 📚 [BookTracker](https://github.com/ErdagEge/book-tracker-app)
A full-stack web app that lets you search, rate, review, and track books you've read — using the Google Books API, React, Express, and MongoDB. It supports adding start/finish dates, inline editing, and live CRUD operations. Fast, clean, and ready for more.

### 🎬 [CineMCP](https://cinemcp-backend.onrender.com)
An AI-assisted movie recommendation web app that personalizes suggestions using user preferences, mood, and real-time movie data from TMDB. Built with vanilla JavaScript (frontend) and modular Node.js/Express (backend), powered by a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) with OpenAI integration.

### 🌌 [Astrophage Tracker](https://github.com/ErdagEge/astrophage-tracker)

Sci-fi themed, single-page React infographic dashboard that monitors solar irradiance on Earth using real NASA POWER API. Inspired by Project Hail Mary, the app simulates the fictional spread of "astrophage" by analyzing real-time energy loss.

### ♟️ [Chess Endgame Trainer](https://github.com/ErdagEge/chess-endgame-trainer)
An interactive training tool that helps players master chess endgames using realistic scenarios. Built with React, TypeScript, and Stockfish, it lets users play out key endgame positions with draggable boards and auto-evaluation.

### ⛅ [Weather App](https://github.com/ErdagEge/weather-app)
A minimalist, responsive weather dashboard built with React and OpenWeatherMap API. It displays current, daily, and hourly forecasts with smooth animations and temperature toggles (C°/F°), using modular, clean architecture and Vite.

### 🎙️ [Podcast Archive Platform](https://erdagege.github.io/podcast-archive/)
A creative podcast archive platform to organize and share cultural and philosophical content from my podcast **Açık Büfe Diyalog**. Built for clarity, long-term access, and themed browsing.

### ✍️ Creative Writing & Worldbuilding
Exploring speculative fiction and interactive storytelling through a worldbuilding project that merges visual art, narrative, and mechanics inspired by fantasy themes.
