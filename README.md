# Hi, I'm Ege! 👋

Software Developer (EE background) focused on building clean, performant web apps and data-aware backends. I enjoy turning messy real-world problems into simple UIs and well-structured APIs. Recently exploring AI-assisted workflows (MCP), practical data modeling, and production hardening.

- 🔭 Current focus: **Fantasy Court Vision** (React + Vite), **Movie Night Negotiator** (Next.js, Supabase Postgres).
- 📝 I write about tech, cinema, and culture on my blog: [**Aegean Dispatch**](https://erdagege.github.io/aegean-dispatch/).
- 🎙️ I also host a culture/philosophy podcast: [**Açık Büfe Diyalog**](https://open.spotify.com/show/5IkatgeB5ZBbbAADZC9Tty?si=8fc45b383d6c40f5).

## What I'm working on

### 🍿 [Movie Night Negotiator](https://github.com/ErdagEge/movie-night-negotiator)
Pick a movie together. Create a lobby, everyone adds titles and ranks them, and the app computes a fair winner (Borda). It’s multiplayer, live, and free-tier friendly. Optional AI provides a short “why this fits everyone” rationale when you finalize.

### 🏀 [Fantasy Court Vision](https://github.com/ErdagEge/fantasy-court-vision)
A React + Vite application for fantasy basketball managers who want quick punt-category rankings and roster analysis.

### 🎬 [CineMCP](https://cinemcp-backend.onrender.com)
An AI-assisted movie recommendation web app that personalizes suggestions using user preferences, mood, and real-time movie data from TMDB. Built with vanilla JavaScript (frontend) and modular Node.js/Express (backend), powered by a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) with OpenAI integration.

### 🌌 [Astrophage Tracker](https://github.com/ErdagEge/astrophage-tracker)
Sci-fi themed, single-page React infographic dashboard that monitors solar irradiance on Earth using real NASA POWER API. Inspired by Project Hail Mary, the app simulates the fictional spread of "astrophage" by analyzing real-time energy loss.
