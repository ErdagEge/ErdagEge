# Hi, I'm Ege! 👋

Software Developer (EE background) focused on building clean, performant web apps and data-aware backends. I enjoy turning messy real-world problems into simple UIs and well-structured APIs. Recently exploring AI-assisted workflows (MCP), practical data modeling, and production hardening.

- 🔭 Current focus: **Movie Night Negotiator** (Next.js, Supabase Postgres), **CineMCP** (AI-assisted movie recs with MCP), **BookTracker** (full-stack React/Express/MongoDB).
- 🎙️ I also host a culture/philosophy podcast: [**Açık Büfe Diyalog**](https://open.spotify.com/show/5IkatgeB5ZBbbAADZC9Tty?si=8fc45b383d6c40f5).

## What I'm working on

### 🍿 [Movie Night Negotiator](https://github.com/ErdagEge/movie-night-negotiator)
Pick a movie together. Create a lobby, everyone adds titles and ranks them, and the app computes a fair winner (Borda). It’s multiplayer, live, and free-tier friendly. Optional AI provides a short “why this fits everyone” rationale when you finalize.

### 📚 [BookTracker](https://github.com/ErdagEge/book-tracker-app)
A full-stack web app that lets you search, rate, review, and track books you've read; using the Google Books API, React, Express, and MongoDB. It supports adding start/finish dates, inline editing, and live CRUD operations. Fast, clean, and ready for more.

### 🎬 [CineMCP](https://cinemcp-backend.onrender.com)
An AI-assisted movie recommendation web app that personalizes suggestions using user preferences, mood, and real-time movie data from TMDB. Built with vanilla JavaScript (frontend) and modular Node.js/Express (backend), powered by a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) with OpenAI integration.

### 🌌 [Astrophage Tracker](https://github.com/ErdagEge/astrophage-tracker)

Sci-fi themed, single-page React infographic dashboard that monitors solar irradiance on Earth using real NASA POWER API. Inspired by Project Hail Mary, the app simulates the fictional spread of "astrophage" by analyzing real-time energy loss.

### ♟️ [Chess Endgame Trainer](https://github.com/ErdagEge/chess-endgame-trainer)
An interactive training tool that helps players master chess endgames using realistic scenarios. Built with React, TypeScript, and Stockfish, it lets users play out key endgame positions with draggable boards and auto-evaluation.

### ⛅ [Weather App](https://github.com/ErdagEge/weather-app)
A minimalist, responsive weather dashboard built with React and OpenWeatherMap API. It displays current, daily, and hourly forecasts with smooth animations and temperature toggles (C°/F°), using modular, clean architecture and Vite.
