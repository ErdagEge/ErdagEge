# Hi, I'm Ege! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a driven software developer with experience in `.NET`, `HTML/CSS`, `JavaScript`, and `Python`. I love problem solving, creating intuitive and engaging web experiences and am deeply interested in blending technology with thoughtful design.

## ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on

* Building an AI-assisted app named CineMCP. CineMCP is a smart movie recommendation web app that personalizes suggestions using user preferences, mood, and real-time movie data from TMDB. It uses a custom-built Model Context Protocol (MCP) to dynamically generate structured prompts, optionally powered by OpenAI. The frontend is built with vanilla JS, and the backend is a modular Node.js + Express server. Lightweight, clean, and easily extendable.
* Building a creative podcast archive platform to organize and share engaging cultural and philosophical content from my beloved podcast AÃ§Ä±k BÃ¼fe Diyalog. Check it out [here](https://erdagege.github.io/podcast-archive/).
* Exploring worldbuilding and creative writing projects that fuse art, storytelling, and interactive elements.
